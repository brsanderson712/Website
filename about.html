	<h1>About me:
	</h1>
	<p>I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University in august of 2018, with a BS in Exercise Science and a Minor in Mathematics.  After graduation is when I was introduced to programming.  I enjoyed it so much I re-enrolled at MTSU to get a degree in Computer Science. I went to school while working at least 30 hours per week.  I married in 2019 to my beautiful wife Kerby.  I made this webpage in February as part of my continual effort to learning more about computer science and to develop my skills.</p>
